# CyberNun-90days-CyberJourney
A 90-days cybersecurity challenge documenting my journey from fundamentals to becoming a confident Cybersecurity Personnel - Mastering Linux, networking, and ethical hacking with discipline and prayer. 
# 🐧 Kali Foundation - Phase 1(Days 1-20)

# 📅 Daily Breakdown

# 📆 Day 1 — Virtualization Setup 
Installed VirtualBox and Kali Linux VM. Took an initial snapshot for system backup.

# 📆 Day 2 — File Navigation
Learned basic Linux commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, and `cat` for navigating files and directories.

# 📆 Day 3 — File Permissions
Explored `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l` to understand and manage file permissions.

# 📆 Day 4 — File Editing
Practiced using `nano`, `vim`, `touch`, and `mkdir` to create and modify files.

# 📆 Day 5 — Process Management
Studied commands such as `ps`, `top`, and `kill` for handling processes.

# 📆 Day 6 — SSH Practice
Completed OverTheWire Bandit Levels 0–5 to strengthen command-line and SSH skills.

 # 🧰Tools Used
VirtualBox→ For creating and running the Kali Linux virtual environment  
-Kali Linux→ Main operating system for hands-on learning  
-Nano&Vim→ Text editors for configuration and scripting practice  
-Linux Commands→ `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, `ps`, etc.  
-OverTheWire Bandit→ Command-line challenge platform for learning through real tasks  


# 💻Hands-On Practice
- Installed and configured Kali Linux inside VirtualBox  
- Navigated the Linux filesystem efficiently using CLI commands  
- Managed file ownerships and permissions  
- Created, edited, and organized files using terminal-based editors  
- Practiced monitoring and controlling running processes  
- Accessed remote systems securely using SSH during Bandit challenges  


# 📚Summary of What I Learned
- How to install and configure a virtual environment using VirtualBox  
- Confidently using Linux navigation and management commands  
- Understanding file permissions and their importance in security  
- Editing and managing files using text editors like Nano and Vim  
- Gaining practical command-line experience through OverTheWire Bandit  


# ⚠️Challenges Face
- Difficulty switching between insert and command mode in Vim  
- Some OverTheWire Bandit levels required deeper command understanding  
- VirtualBox setup errors during initial configuration  
- Occasional command typos and syntax errors that caused task delays  

# 🎯Goals for Next Week
- Practice networking basics (ping, netstat, ifconfig)
- Learn about ports and services
- Learn netcat basics (nc, port scanning)
- Continue OverTheWire Bandit (levels 6-10)
